Filtration!

# The 4 Levels of Filtration
## Textile FIlter
The textile filter is used to remove the big chuncks out of the water, so the rest of the system gets less load, and therefor has to be replaced less often.
## Sand Filter
The sand filter is used to remove most of the particles in the water.
## Active Carbon Filter
The active carbon binds everything that is left over.
## UV Treatment
The treatment with UV Ligth ensures that no bacteria and therefor pathogens are left in the water. Is good pratice to overdiemsion this filter by about factor 10.
